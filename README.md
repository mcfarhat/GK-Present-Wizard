=== Short Summary ===

The GK Present Wizard is a wordpress plugin that functions on top of woocommerce and brings the functionality of having a wizard/game like functionality onto your wordpress site so as user information can be used to generate relevant and fun gifts.

== Description ==

The plugin turns your wordpress installation's front end into an interface with the present wizard being the sole functionality. 

The user will initially need to connect his facebook account. This functionality is essentially handled utilizing the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/facebookall/">Facebookall</a> plugin. Once the Facebook connection is properly initiated, the user will become logged in, and will be presented with a set of category to chose from.

Chosing the category, the user's data will be considered to go through the list of available gifts, which are built based on the existing woocommerce products setup into the system, and then a suitable gift will be presented to the visitor. A relevant image of the user's profile pic along with the gift will be dynamically generated, and made ready to be shared onto facebook and/or other social media.
Each product to be properly included into the selection will need to contain at least 2 pieces of meta data: gender and age, which would allow characterization of the products accordingly.
Alternatively, if the user does not like the gift, he can always click the search again button, in which case he will be presented with an alternative option or a gift.
